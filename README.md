# Robotron 2000 (JavaScript DOM Course)

This is a repository cloned for me to learn (and only learn) about the **JavaScript's Document Object Model**. The base files from this project was provided by the course teacher, so we as students could go right to the point.

## Page and Documentation

If you want to see the project working, you can go right to [the site](https://magnic0.github.io/alura-js-dom/), but there's also a documentation in portuguese that I've created for future consulting that you can find [right here](notes.md).
